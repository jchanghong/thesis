\begin{Eabstract}{Distributed Database}{Relational Database}{Non Relational Database}{Data Security}{Load Balancing}
Since the invention of the previous world, the relational database system has become the first choice database system for the enterprise to store data. But in the era of mobile Internet, the storage and processing of a large number of unstructured data is not a strong relation to the database. According to the shortcomings of the relational database system, non relational database, there have been a variety of such key database is used to store the most simple data; document database is used to store a large number of pictures or document data; graphic database system for storing user related data.
Each database system has its place, but the enterprises with different types of databases to store different types of data, resulting in the waste of server resources, increase the cost of maintenance, database system design and so is of great significance to realize the database management system for storage and management of various types of data.

When storing all data in a database system, we must ensure that the system can be deployed in distributed environment to expand its read and write ability, and also ensure data security of the system. Based on the above requirements, this paper designs and implements a distributed database system JSQL, which combines the advantages of relational database and non relational database systems, storage of structured and unstructured data types, multiple master distributed architecture can be dynamically expanded reading and writing ability, but also from the bottom into the audit function to guarantee the security of data.

After the analysis of the system requirements and related technologies, the paper first expounds the functions and architecture of the system.
JSQL adopts the commonly used customer service end - server architecture, which is divided into customer service and server side.
The server side is also divided into distributed management nodes and distributed database clusters.
Distributed management node realizes load balancing function and monitoring management function of distributed database system. Distributed database cluster realizes data storage and management. Secondly, detailed design and implementation of load balancing module in client and distributed management node, data audit module, database function module in distributed database cluster node, distributed cluster architecture module and audit log storage module are designed and implemented. In order to balance the server resources, a new dynamic load balancing algorithm is designed and implemented. In order to improve the update performance of the system, this paper proposes a multi master distributed architecture based on distributed queue. Thirdly, the structured storage and audit functions of the distributed database are tested, and the test results are given and analyzed. Finally, the shortcomings of the system described in this paper and the follow-up work of the paper are summarized, and the future development of the database system is expected.
