Since the invention of the relational database system in the world, it has become the preferred database system for enterprises to store data. However, in the era of mobile Internet, the storage and processing of a large amount of unstructured data is not the strength of relational databases. For the shortcomings of relational database system, there have been a variety of non-relational databases, such as key-value database to store the simplest relational user data; A document database is used to store a large number of pictures or document data; The graphical database system is used to store associated data from the recommendation engine.Every kind of database system has the opportunity of exerting its ability, but enterprises use different kinds of databases to store different types of data, which leads to the waste of server resources and increases the maintenance cost of database system, so, It is of great significance to design and implement a database management system that can store and manage multiple data types.

When all data is stored in a database system, it is necessary to ensure that the system can be deployed in a distributed environment to expand its ability to read and write, and to ensure the data security of the system. Based on the above requirements, this paper designs and implements a distributed database system, JSQL, which combines the advantages of relational database system and non-relational database system, can store structured and unstructured data types, and supports multi-master distributed architecture. Can dynamically expand the ability to read and write, but also from the bottom to add audit functions to ensure the security of data.

After analyzing the system requirements and related technologies, the paper first describes the functions and architecture of the system.JSQL adopts the customer-server architecture, which is divided into customer service end and server side.The server is divided into distributed management node and distributed database cluster.The distributed management node realizes the load balancing function and the monitoring management function of the distributed database system, and the distributed database cluster realizes the data storage and management. Secondly, Detailed design and implementation of the client and distributed management node load balancing module, data audit module and distributed database cluster node in the database function module, distributed cluster architecture module and audit log storage module. In order to balance server resources, this paper designs and implements a new dynamic load balancing algorithm. In order to improve the performance of system update, this paper proposes a multi-host distributed architecture based on distributed queue. Thirdly, the structured storage function and audit function of distributed database are tested, and the test results are given and analyzed. Finally, the paper summarizes the shortcomings of the system and the follow-up work, and looks forward to the future development of the database system.
