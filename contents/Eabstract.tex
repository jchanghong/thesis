With the rapid development of Internet application and computer technology, the database has gradually become the core of information system
Points and widely used in enterprises, financial institutions, government and national defense and other fields.
However, the traditional relational database is facing increasing
When exposed to a large number of data a lot of problems, can not be efficient and real-time processing. The new needs of the system
Seeking, the traditional relational database can not be solved very well.
Non-relational database is to make up for the lack of relational database, the OrientDB database
Is a non-relational database. At present, the existing non-relational database has great ability to handle large amounts of data
But in many key areas, relational databases are non-relational databases that can not be replaced.
How to combine the advantages of relational databases and non-relational databases has become the key issue in the current database area.

Through the study of distributed theory, relational database theory and non-relational database technology,
This article based on the Java language to achieve a distributed relational database JSQL, JSQL is a relational database technology,
The combination of non-relational database technology and distributed technology. JSQL common client-server - server architecture, divided into customer service and server-side,
Server-side is divided into distributed management nodes and distributed database nodes.
Distributed management nodes to achieve a database server load balancing and monitoring and management functions. Distributed database node contains five major modules,
The network module accepts the connection request of the front-end application, authenticates and authorizes the client-end, and manages the connection,
And realize the communication protocol based on Mysql, so easy to migrate to Mysql users to the system;
Sql parsing and execution module to accept the client's SQL request, and then parse and execute the database stored call,
Return the execution result
The audit module is to store and analyze all changes to the database, the distributed management node to provide audit data;
The database engine module makes use of the non-relational OrientDB database engine for reliable data storage;
Distributed modules use hazlcast to implement a database cluster.
Based on the above functional modules, JSQL has high availability, scalability, load balancing and other characteristics, while taking into account the database security audit needs from the bottom of the database,
Joined the data audit graphical interface shows the audit results.

The thesis has carried on the function and the performance test to the system. The result of function test shows that the system conforms to the basic requirements of distributed database functionally, and the function of auditing system also meets the requirements of this dissertation. Papers through the performance test results analysis, that the performance of the system basically meet the requirements of this paper. However, the system of complex SQL statement support is not perfect, and finally proposed an improved program.
